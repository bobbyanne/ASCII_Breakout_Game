Doing my best over here...

  Good job.  Your getting the hang of for loops.  That was the hardest part for me.
  Coding is like solving a puzzle you just keep trying different pieces until you
  get the desired result.  A programmer is really just a problem solver.  Keep writing
  more console applications and don't get bogged down with things like web apps 
  windows forms just yet.  After you gain some confidence I suggest reading 
  Head Start C#.  This book we'll teach you some basics about flashy application development
  but it goes over the basic types and stuff your learning now. You'll see a lot of the same 
  information that you think you already know but never skip it, it might shed new light 
  on a concept you weren't exactly 100% correct on.
